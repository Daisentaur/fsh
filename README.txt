This is a ship route optimisation algorithm code made to help determine an optimal path from one port to another in the Indian ocean while taking factors like weather, physical dangers of the sea, fuel costs, time taken to reach the destination from the origin. 

This algorithm is made with the help of an ant colony algorithm (https://github.com/gopurakshith/Shipping-with-Inelligent-Routing/blob/master/AntColonyOptimization.py) which was originally made to solve the traveling salesmen problem, which we have taken from and used to find the optimal route in the sea.

We have taken a semi-extensive database of some of the busiest and most important ports in the Indian ocean and our algorithm can give the shortest most economic and time saving path between the selected ports.
